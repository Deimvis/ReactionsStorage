# Design V2

## Updates

* Change from Application configuration to Namespaces
* Change from post_id to entity_id (since messages and other entities do not match name "post" expectations)
* TODO: add the way to specify the order of reactions (different modes, probably manage by popularity / suggest the most popular for particular user)
